# 🧠 ML/AI Paper Deep Dives

A personal documentation repository for studying foundational and breakthrough machine learning papers with a study group of ML enthusiasts who are passionate about understanding **how modern AI really works** under the hood.

## 🎯 About

This repository is where we document our journey through the most **influential papers** that have shaped modern AI and machine learning. Each paper is studied thoroughly—not just skimmed—with a focus on:
- Understanding the **core concepts** and **innovations** that made each paper groundbreaking
- Building **intuition** for why certain approaches work
- Connecting **theoretical foundations** to **practical implications**
- Exploring **resources** (videos, podcasts, articles, code) that help cement understanding

We believe in **active learning**: reading the paper multiple times, discussing it together, implementing key concepts, and creating our own explanations.

## 📚 Papers Studied

### ✅ Completed
- **[Attention Is All You Need](./papers/attention-is-all-you-need/)** — The paper that revolutionized modern AI with the Transformer architecture

### 🔜 Coming Soon
*More foundational papers will be added as we continue our study sessions*

## 📂 Repository Structure

Each paper has its own directory under `/papers` organized as:
```
papers/
└── [paper-name]/
    ├── overview.md       # Quick overview, key contributions, and why it matters
    ├── notes.md          # Detailed study notes and curated resources
    └── docs/             # Supplementary materials (slides, PDFs, annotations)
        ├── *.pptx        # Presentation materials
        └── *.pdf         # PDF exports or handwritten notes
```

## 👥 Study Group

This documentation is part of a **collaborative study group** focused on understanding the foundations of modern ML/AI technologies. We meet regularly to:
- Deep dive into seminal papers together
- Share insights and explanations that click
- Build intuition through discussion and debate
- Create resources that help each other learn

## 🤝 Contributing

This is primarily a personal learning repository for our study group, but if you're part of the group or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or reach out!

## 🎓 Learning Goals

- 🧩 Understand the **evolution of key ML concepts** from first principles
- 💡 Build **intuition** for breakthrough innovations (not just memorize formulas)
- 🔗 Connect **theoretical foundations** to **practical applications**
- 📖 Develop **critical reading skills** for technical papers
- 🛠️ Bridge the gap between **research papers** and **real implementations**
